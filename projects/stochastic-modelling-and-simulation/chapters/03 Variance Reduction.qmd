# Variance reduction methods

For a Monte Carlo sampling method we wish to reduce the variance when sampling
    such that every new sample is a bit more precise.

We can often sample from an intractable distribution or integral.
    but we don't know the actual parameters.

# Crude Monte Carlo

Sampling 100 points from a uniform distribution, passing them through the intractable distribution.

Computing the mean and comparing to the true mean.


# Antithetic variables

# Control variable

# Statified sampling

# Importance sampling
