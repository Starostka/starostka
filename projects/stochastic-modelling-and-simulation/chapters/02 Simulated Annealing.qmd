# Simulated annealing

Is a stochastic approximation method that seeks a global maximum.

It works by sampling from a proposal distribution and evaluating the cost function for current state vs sampled state.

Dependening on the acceptance ratio, we accept or decline.

# Create n stations and define the cost function

We create n stations for the travelling salesman problem
    the cost function computes the cost of travelling a given route
    using euclidean distances.

# Approximating global minimum using simulated annealing

First we permute a route, i.e., we swap two stations as our symmetric proposal distribution.

Using the acceptance probability, we either accept or decline s*

For each iteration we update the temperature. Usually by lowering it to reduce activity.
